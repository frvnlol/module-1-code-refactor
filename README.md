# Module 1 Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

Horiseon is a marketing agency that has hired me to refactor the code to their landing page to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.

Through adding semantic elements, consolidating repeating CSS styles with their respective classes and tags and moving them so they are in sequential in accordance to the HTML file, I've made it easier for the company and future developers to read the code in case any future changes need to be made.

By doing this challenge, I have learned the importance of properly using semantic elements not only to make it easier to group and read each section of the HTML file, but to also make styling the page with CSS that much easier.
